# README Generator 

## Description

This project allows a user to create a professional readme file using CLI. This allows users to save time by answering command line questions, and getting their answer formatted properly into a readme file.

## Installation

The readme generator requires the installation of node.js, npm, and npm inquirer.

## Usage

Open your index.js file in the integrated terminal. Run node index.js. This will prompt you to answer a series of quetions about the application you have created. For open-ended question, type your answer then hit enter. To select from a menu (in the cas of licenses) use you arrow keys to navigate up and down the list, hitting enter when the one you want is selected. After you answer all of the questions, a README.md file will be created for your project, with the information you provided.
